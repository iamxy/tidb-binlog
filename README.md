## How to build

```
make build   # build all compoents

make pump    # build pump

make drainer # build drainer
```

When build successfully, you can find the binary in bin directory. 

## Service list

[pump](./cmd/pump)

pump is a daemon that receives realtime binlog from tidb-server and writes in sequential disk files synchronously.

[drainer](./cmd/drainer)

drainer collects binlog from each pump in cluster, transforms binlog to various dialects of SQL, and applies to downstream database or filesystem.

## Deployment

The recommended startup sequence: PD -> TiKV -> [pump](./cmd/pump) -> TiDB -> [drainer](./cmd/drainer)
